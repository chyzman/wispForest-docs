# Alloy Forgery

Alloy Forgery is a mod all about forging metals. 

If you are a player looking for info on how to make an Alloy Forge, see the ["Building a Forge"](../building-a-forge) section. We recommend a mod like Roughly Enough Items or EMI to view alloy recipes. 

By default, Alloy Forgery provides no new materials, but it does provide recipes for smelting ores into extra ingots. It also supports a handful of mods out of the box, [which you can see here.](https://github.com/wisp-forest/alloy-forgery/tree/1.20/src/main/resources/data/alloy_forgery/recipes/compat)

Furthermore, if you need any assistance on finding out how to create a Datapack in general, you can see [Datapack Tutorial](../datapack-tutorial.md) for help with such.
